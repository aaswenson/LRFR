# this is pseudo code for a Liquid Reactor Reprocessing Code

user defined inputs

text file the user modifies containing:
	reprocessing mass flow rates
	fuel material
	reprocessing efficiency
	desired mcnp version?
	burnup intervals
	reprocessing intervals
	ask if there is an exclusive fertile region
		will this region be reprocessed?
code will read text file and user supplied inputs
the user inputs should be a module so values can be imported throughout code

########################## INPUT PREPARATION ########################

parse the mcnp input file:
	search for fissile and fertile fuel
	based on search results, define cells eligible for reprocessing
		these will not change throughout burnup
		set in beginning in case of unlikely generation in 
		unwanted region

run the mcnp file
save output file
clean directory
	make file?

########################## OUTPUT PROCESSING ########################

parse the mcnp output file:
	search for composition of previously defined cells
