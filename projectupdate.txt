### APRIL 8TH LRFR PROJECT UPDATE
 
 
As of April 8th, we have installed and acquainted ourselves with PyNE.
Our pseudo code has been expanded (potential room for more expansion).
We have been investigating the potential use of the PyNE MCNP module to fetch
material data from MCNP input and output files.
 
SETBACKS:
 
We did not accomplish as much as we wanted to over spring break and the week
of the ANS conference. We are currently working on getting the PyNE module
 
adapted for MCNP output files. We are also working on script interfacing,
it is not immediately evident how the python scripts will interface for the
end-user package. We are considering a bash script to call the various python
scripts and MCNP commands.
